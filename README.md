This Tableau visualization presents a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 vaccination trends.

The dashboard includes:

- % of Population Fully Vaccinated: A time series chart tracking the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals across different countries.
  
- Vaccinated Population Based on Continents: A pie chart illustrating vaccination distribution across major continents, providing a clear view of global vaccination disparities.
  
- Partially and Fully Vaccinated Population: A cumulative area chart visualizing the growth in the number of people partially and fully vaccinated over time.
  
- Population Fully and Partially Vaccinated (Sept 13, 2021): A bar chart showing the vaccination status across key countries as of a specific date.
